# Python Project Boiler Plate
The Python project boiler plate supports test driven development of custom Python packages and Jupyter notebooks. This includes a series of batch scripts to expedite set up and development.

# Note
The parent directory for the project should not contain any spaces for the batch scripts to work as expected.
